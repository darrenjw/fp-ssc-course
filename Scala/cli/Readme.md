# CLI

## scala-cli examples

This directory contains stand-alone `scala-cli` scripts. It is not part of the `sbt` project.

Individual `scala-cli` scripts can typically be run by typing `scala-cli scriptname.scala` at your OS command prompt. Note that required dependencies are specified in the script headers. Command-line arguments can be provided following a `--` separator.
