### An introduction to functional programming for scalable statistical computing and machine learning

## A half-day short-course

A brief introduction to ideas of functional programming in the context of scalable statistical computing, illustrated with hands-on examples in Scala, Haskell, Python+JAX and Dex.

The first iteration of this course will be delivered to [StatML](https://statml.io/) students on 2023-02-16.

*Please note that you need to install some software on your system **in advance** of the course.* See the [Setup](Setup.md) guide for details.

You will also need a copy of this repo. If you know git, clone it ASAP, and then do a pull the day before the course. If you don't know git, click on the green "Code" button and download a zip file, but do (or re-do) this the day before the course to make sure you have an up-to-date version.

It would also be useful to have a copy of my [logreg](https://github.com/darrenjw/logreg) repo, which explores MCMC algorithms in a variety of (functional) languages.
