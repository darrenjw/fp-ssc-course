# Haskell crash course

Haskell is similar to Scala in the sense that it is a strongly typed functional programming language with a sophisticated type system. However, it is much purer than Scala, and unlike Scala, evaluation is *lazy*, rather than *strict* by default. There are pros and cons with this, which we don't have time to explore today. It also uses a slightly different syntax. 

A REPL can be called up by running `ghci` from the command line. GHC is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (the "standard" Haskell compiler), and the "i" is for "interactive".
