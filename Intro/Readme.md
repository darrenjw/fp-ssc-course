# Introduction

## Functional programming for scalable statistical computing and ML




### Learning resources

Below are some links for further information about the languages and libraries briefly introduced in this course.

#### Scala

* [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/) - main web site
    * [Learning resources](https://docs.scala-lang.org/)
* [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) - unfortunately this book is not free, but remains one of the best introductions to functional programming (in any language)
    * [Chapter notes](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala)
* [Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/) - libraries for functional programming in Scala
    * [Spire](https://typelevel.org/spire/) - numerics library
	* [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) - category theory abstractions for pure functional programming
	* [Monocle](https://www.optics.dev/Monocle/) - lens/optics library
	* [FS2](https://fs2.io/) - pure functional streaming data library
* [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/) - numerical linear algebra and scientific computing (like numpy/scipy for Scala)
* [Smile](https://haifengl.github.io/) - Statistical machine learning library (like scikit-learn for Scala)
* [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) - library for parallel and distributed big data processing


#### Haskell


* Category theory for programmers, by [Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/)
    * [Blog post series](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
    * [Book](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/)
	    * [Scala edition](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
    * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8BtBl8PNgd3vWKtm2yJ7aA)
	    * [Series 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_)
	    * [Series 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm)
	    * [Series 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEn64WVX4B08B4h2rOtueWIL)
    * **New book!**: [The Dao of FP](https://github.com/BartoszMilewski/Publications/raw/master/TheDaoOfFP/DaoFP.pdf) - this is now possibly the best introduction to the ideas of category theory in the context of functional programming
